        <h2>Salmon Cookies - The Treat So Sweet, You'll Swim Upstream for Them!</h2>
        <p>It's a beautiful, sunny morning in high summer in the North Cascades. You're making your way down to the
          stony bank of a clear, cool river, and you see a beautiful sight: slick, shining salmon leaping out of the
          rapids as they make their way up the river! Suddenly, you're hungry . . . BECAUSE YOU'RE A BEAR!</p>

        <p>. . . Or are you?</p>

        <p>Maybe you're a fly fisherman. Or maybe you're just any animal that walks on two legs. Because if there's one
          thing we humans in the Pacific Northwest Know, it's that nothing has the same beautiful taste of
          salmon caught right out of the water. Healthy, hearty, a little sweet, and savory for every bite, salmon was
          made for eating every way from
          sushi to sous vide. It's too bad salmon just isn't the kind of thing you can easily take with you as a snack
          on the go.</p>

        <p>. . . Until now.</p>
        <img id="fish" src="images/fish.jpg">
        <p>Here at Salmon Cookies, we've come up with yet another preparation in which this perfect pesce (that's
          Italian for
          'fish') can be eaten—and you can probably guess what's coming . . . Yes, we're talking about salmon cookies!
        </p>

        <p>Skeptical? Of course not, you came to a website called Salmon Cookies for a reason. But in case you are, ask
          yourself this: what could be better than bringing together mother nature's most delicious fish in the sea,
          with the pinnacle of human civilization's achievements in baking? Nothing. Want to know why? Because like any
          couple that was always meant to be together, they bring out the best in each other. The freshness of salmon,
          and the chewy goodness of a cookie, all in handy snacking form.</p>

        <p>If you're mouth is watering, then you're in luck: Salmon Cookies are available at our five international
          locations right now—and if you're not near one, don't worry, because we can ship them to you! Whatever your
          needs, we're going to do all we can to help you get your hands—or claws—on one of our cookies . . . Or maybe a
          dozen .
          . . Or maybe a whole school! We're sure you've going to love them, human OR bear.</p>
